What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It makes the repository a git repository. Its needed so that we can add commits to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is an intermediate stage before we commit to a repository. Its not a fixed state like wd or repository. It offres value as we can differentiate between files we really need to add to commit.
